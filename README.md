An attempt at using libarea to generate CNC toolpaths. It should eliminate the need for my gcode_subs project, if it ever works.

First step is to support reading DXF files; eventually handling FreeCAD/STEP/STL files would be nice.

It's advised to use a fixed version of libarea (better DXF handling, issue with undefined symbols resolved): https://github.com/dbtayl/libarea
